
* Networking code
    + Rewrite client-side TCP code (DONE)
    + Rewrite server-side TCP/UDP code (DONE)
    + Implement map transfers (DONE)
    + Logins are excessively long (FIXED)
    - Find fixes for cases like a lack of UDP accessibility in either direction
    - Implement crucial things like MSG_MAPTRANSFER and MSG_PLAYERHOME

* Graphics
    + Map surface splitter (ADDED)
    + Underscore in rendered text looks funky (FIXED)
    - Blinking flags (when dropped)
    + Can still shoot in observation mode (FXED)
    + Can shoot while dead (FIXED)
    - Weapons can hit dead targets
    - Smoking ships (armor critical)
    - Powerups
    + MeX and MeY have caused weird issues throughout (not currently, but possibly in the future)
      Use the following code for MeX and MeY
            short CenterSX = g_graphics->GetCenterX() - 16,
                  CenterSY = g_graphics->GetCenterY() - 16;
            short MeX = (short)(g_game->m_me->GetX() - CenterSX),
                  MeY = (short)(g_game->m_me->GetY() - CenterSY);

* Other ideas
    - Maybe an in-game server list and lobby?

* MSG_WEPSYNC seems to force laser energy up when it shouldn't (i.e. after firing a missile)

* UI
	+ Radar background and health/laser bars are fully opaque in OpenGL mode (FIXED)
	  glTexEnv was being passed GL_REPLACE rather than GL_MODULATE.
    - Preferences interface
    - Team switcher
    - Current game statistics (F1)
    - Team scores
    - Holding pen timeout
    - Radar
    - Clickable sidebar buttons
    - Sidebar menus (top right, radar area)
    - Help menus

* Do performance analysis and optimize slow points.

* Do memory leak/error detection.
