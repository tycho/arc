SEdit v2.02.00 - Stable
Release Date: 12.12.2002

All changes were made before the creation of this changelog. SEdit really depends on its location.
You must have SEdit stored in the same location as ARC.exe. SEdit reads the same data files that ARC
does for animations. This file is called "Gfx.dll" under the current version of ARC. Also, SEdit
requires the file "custom.dat" for any complex tools (wall, bridge, bunker, etc.) to work properly.
"tiles.bmp" is also required, or you won't see much of anything.

New tools:
overview exportation (Edit -> Overview -> Export)
line tool (similar to wall tool, check it out.)
